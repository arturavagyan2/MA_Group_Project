# Group 6 - Marketing Analytics Project for Streaming Services

## Project Objective

Our project aims to address the issue of declining customer retention and subscriber attrition of the aforementioned subscription-based companies and others alike by developing a Python package that will make use of RFM analysis, offering insights into behavior patterns, client segmentation, and their likelihood of churn.

## How It Works

1. **Data Input**: The package requires subscription data, including subscriber activity and transaction history.
2. **Analysis**: The RFM model segments subscribers based on their recency, frequency, and monetary value contributions to the service.
3. **Insights and Actions**: Based on the analysis, the package provides actionable insights for improving customer retention strategies.
