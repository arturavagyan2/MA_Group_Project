# Marketing Analytics Project for Streaming Services

## Problem Definition

Subscription-based streaming companies like Disney+ and Hulu are facing a critical challenge: a decline in customer retention. Despite offering diverse content libraries, user-friendly platforms, and enjoying global fame, these companies are struggling to maintain their subscriber bases amidst fierce competition and frequent pricing adjustments. This issue not only leads to a reduction in paid subscriptions but also represents a significant threat to the sustainability and growth of streaming platforms, impacting their ability to generate revenue and invest in content development.

## Project Objective

Our project aims to tackle the issue of declining customer retention and subscriber attrition among subscription-based streaming companies. We are developing a Python package that utilizes RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to provide insights into subscriber behavior patterns, client segmentation, and their likelihood of churn. This tool will help streaming service companies optimize their retention strategies and enhance their understanding of subscriber loyalty. Our solution seeks to support the sustained growth and revenue generation of these platforms in the highly competitive streaming landscape.

## Features

- **RFM Analysis**: Our package conducts RFM analysis to segment customers based on their behavior and interaction with the service. This segmentation allows for targeted marketing strategies and personalized subscriber experiences.
- **Behavioral Insights**: Gain deep insights into the behavior patterns of your subscribers. Understand what drives loyalty and what factors contribute to churn.
- **Retention Strategy Optimization**: Use our analytical tools to refine and implement effective retention strategies that resonate with your audience segments.
- **Competitive Advantage**: Equip your business with the knowledge to stay ahead in the competitive streaming service market. Understand your audience better than ever before.

## How It Works

1. **Data Input**: The package requires subscription data, including subscriber activity and transaction history.
2. **Analysis**: The RFM model segments subscribers based on their recency, frequency, and monetary value contributions to the service.
3. **Insights and Actions**: Based on the analysis, the package provides actionable insights for improving customer retention strategies.
