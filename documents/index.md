# Welcome to SuRFM

Group 6 - Marketing Analytics Project for Streaming Services

## Project Objective

Our project aims to address the issue of declining customer retention and subscriber attrition in subscription-based companies, particularly in the context of streaming services. We propose the development of a Python package named SuRFM, leveraging RFM analysis to offer insights into behavior patterns, client segmentation, and their likelihood of churn.
