# Welcome to SuRFM Documentation

Group 6 - Marketing Analytics Project for Streaming Services

## Overview
In the competitive landscape of streaming services, maintaining customer retention and minimizing subscriber attrition are critical challenges. The SuRFM (Surfing the Subscribers RFM) Python package is designed to address these issues by providing a sophisticated analytical tool. Developed by Group 6 (Artur Avagyan, Elen Galoyan, Hrag Sousani, Ina Karapetyan, Khoren Movsisyan) for a Marketing Analytics Project, this tool leverages RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to offer actionable insights into subscriber behavior patterns.

## The Problem
Streaming services face significant challenges in retaining subscribers due to the dynamic nature of consumer preferences and the intense competition in the market. Identifying at-risk subscribers before they churn and understanding the factors influencing their decisions are crucial for maintaining a stable and growing subscriber base.

## The Solution
SuRFM provides a robust solution by segmenting subscribers based on their engagement levels as indicated by their Recency, Frequency, and Monetary contributions. By analyzing these segments, SuRFM helps identify subscribers who are most likely to churn and offers tailored strategies to re-engage them.

## Expected Outcomes
By implementing SuRFM, streaming services can expect the following outcomes:
- **Improved Subscriber Retention**: Targeted interventions based on RFM analysis help in retaining at-risk subscribers.
- **Increased Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**: By extending the retention span of subscribers, their lifetime value to the business increases.
- **Enhanced Targeting Strategies**: Data-driven insights facilitate more effective marketing and promotional campaigns.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Streamlined processes for identifying and addressing subscriber needs, reducing overheads related to customer management.

## Features
- **Data Input**: Processes subscription data, including activity and transaction history.
- **Analysis**: Segments subscribers based on their RFM values.
- **Insights and Actions**: Provides actionable insights to enhance customer retention strategies.
